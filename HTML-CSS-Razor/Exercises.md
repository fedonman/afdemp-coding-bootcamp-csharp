# HTML & CSS / Bootstrap Framework / Razor


## Exercise `Personal Website - HTML`
Your ultimate task is to create a fully functional Personal Website (PW). The PW has three pages:

1. __Home__ page. The home page consists of:  
  * Heading with your tagline  
  * A photo of you and short description  
  * List of academic experience
  * List of hobbies
2. __Blog__ page. The blog page includes a list of posts.
  * Each post has a title, date, category and content.
  * Content may include text, images, videos organized in one or more sections. Create at least 3-4 different variations. You can use real-world posts.
  * Blog page also has a search field for searching posts and a dropdown for selecting category.
3. __Contact__ page. The contact page has two sections:
  * A short call-to-action: why someone should contact you.
  * A form for contacting you. The form should have, at least, Name*, Email*, Message* fields.

All pages have
* a header (title of the page + navigation menu)
* a footer (copyright info)

Since current PW is a static website, you have to hardcode every information. Try to use semantically correct HTML!


## Exercise `Personal Website - CSS`
Style your PW.

### Fonts
Use `Open Sans` from Google Fonts for every text. Define font size / line height / font weight for each text element. Font color should be #222222.

### Links
Links should be purple (find your own variance). On hover they should become black.

### Layout
The PW should be full-width and have background color of white.

Header is 80px height and has the Title aligned on the left with a 20px left margin and Navigation on the right. Choose a combination of background - text colors. (You can either keep the dark fonts and choose a light(but not white) background or the opposite).

Footer is 80px height and has the text aligned to center. Background-color is the same as the rest website, but has a border of 1px on the top.

### Home Page
The Tagline section is full-screen with the text aligned to center both horizontally and vertically.
The rest sections have maximum width 60% of the screen size, are center-aligned and have text-align: justify.

Use Flexbox!
